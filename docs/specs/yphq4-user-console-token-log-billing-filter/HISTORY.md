# History

- 2026-06-09: Created the fast-track spec for user-console token recent request filtering, 50-row
  default length, and billable-only request-kind filtering.
- 2026-06-10: Implemented the API filter contract, user-console log metadata, desktop 10-row scroll
  layout, mobile entry-only detail surface, Storybook checks, and updated visual evidence.
- 2026-07-14: Reworked the desktop scroll header into a synchronized blurred backdrop after native
  backdrop filtering failed to obscure row text consistently inside the table scroll container, and
  tuned the replacement surface to keep visible translucent blur in both themes without letting row
  text remain legible.
