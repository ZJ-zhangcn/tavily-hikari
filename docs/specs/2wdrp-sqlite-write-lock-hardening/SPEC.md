# SQLite write-lock hardening（#2wdrp）

## Background

Production `tavily-hikari` `0.46.2` showed transient SQLite `database is locked` errors after API
rebalance was enabled. The service remained healthy, but logs included request-path failures such as
`token billing lock failed` for `/api/tavily/search` and `/api/tavily/extract`, plus MCP session
lock failures and background job start failures.

The observed behavior points to SQLite writer contention rather than API rebalance selector
misrouting. Billing, MCP session serialization, quota sync, scheduled job logging, LinuxDo OAuth
upserts, and rollups all share the same SQLite database and can briefly compete for the single
writer slot.

Forward-proxy startup also participates in this same lock budget: it refreshes subscription-backed
endpoints, syncs xray state, and persists runtime snapshots before the HTTP server reports itself
ready. That startup path can amplify a short writer collision into a slow first healthy when the
runtime snapshot write collides with other writers.

Dockrev `job_01KSEPDVXF8NAQCEQGJKV33T4F` showed a related startup-order failure after the previous
hardening: the service was healthy before restart, but startup still waited on remote subscription
refresh before restoring the locally persisted subscription runtime. A restart should recover known
proxy nodes from `forward_proxy_runtime` first; remote subscription refresh is only the calibration
source when a usable persisted runtime already exists.

## Goals

- Keep request-path billing and MCP session locks from failing on transient SQLite busy/locked
  errors when the existing bounded wait budget can absorb the contention.
- Preserve quota ledger correctness, pending billing replay, session affinity, research key pinning,
  and API rebalance behavior.
- Make background job bookkeeping tolerate transient lock pressure without amplifying request-path
  failures.
- Keep forward-proxy startup from turning short SQLite writer contention into a long readiness
  delay.
- Cover the lock-contention behavior with local tests that use only local/mock state.

## Non-goals

- No production data repair, destructive maintenance, or hand-written production ledger SQL.
- No increase to the SQLite connection pool as the primary fix.
- No billing reservation redesign unless this hardening proves insufficient.
- No change to public HTTP, MCP, DB schema, or frontend contracts.

## Requirements

- `quota_subject_locks` acquire/refresh/release writes must retry transient SQLite write errors with
  bounded backoff and must remain inside the existing lock timeout/lease budget.
- Token billing and MCP session lock callers must retain the current fail-closed semantics if the
  bounded retry window is exhausted.
- `scheduled_jobs` must remain the persisted fact source for maintenance work, but it now needs a
  first-class queued lifecycle: `queued` rows persist before execution, `queued_at` records queue
  admission time, and `started_at` only records the actual execution start time.
- `scheduled_jobs` enqueue/start/finish writes must retry transient SQLite write errors before
  surfacing a background job logging failure.
- LinuxDo OAuth account upsert/refresh calls must retry transient SQLite write errors at the proxy
  boundary so a short writer collision does not immediately fail user login/profile sync.
- `forward_proxy` startup runtime snapshot persistence must retry transient SQLite write errors with
  bounded backoff so a short writer collision does not delay readiness longer than necessary.
- Startup subscription refresh may fetch multiple subscription URLs concurrently, as long as the
  refresh still fails closed when every subscription fetch fails.
- Startup must restore persisted subscription endpoints before remote subscription refresh when
  their configured subscription ownership is unambiguous. When at least one restored subscription
  endpoint exists, startup must not block on remote refresh before xray sync/runtime persistence;
  without safely restorable endpoints, startup continues to wait for subscription readiness.
- Scheduled job records must preserve the logical job type and record the trigger source separately
  as `scheduler`, `manual`, or `auto`. Manual runs must not be encoded by appending suffixes to
  `job_type`.
- Manual scheduled-job triggers must use the same execution path as scheduler runs, coalesce onto an
  existing `queued`/`running` representative row of the same logical job, and return that
  representative `job_id` instead of rejecting on a shared execution gate timeout.
- Manual trigger responses may add queue-state hints such as representative `status`,
  `coalesced=true`, and `promoted=true` as long as the existing `jobId` / `jobType` /
  `triggerSource` contract remains backward compatible.
- `request_logs_gc` must not hold the SQLite write slot for an unbounded full-retention cleanup
  pass. It must delete old `request_logs` and `request_log_catalog_rollups` in bounded batches,
  yield between batches, report partial progress, and continue catch-up after a throttled delay when
  more rows remain.
- `quota_sync` and `quota_sync/hot` must run under a bounded runtime budget. Upstream `/usage`
  fetches must use a hard timeout, timeout/error paths must finish the `scheduled_jobs` row as
  `error`, and failed runs must not write quota snapshot/sample data.
- Claiming `quota_sync` / `quota_sync/hot` must abandon stale `running` rows older than the
  configured timeout window inside the same claim transaction, so a stuck job does not block future
  sync attempts forever.
- DB-backed scheduled and manual maintenance jobs that can write SQLite must flow through one
  persisted maintenance queue and one single-process worker. The worker may orchestrate remote I/O
  phases outside the DB execution window, but only one maintenance job may hold the SQLite-writing
  execution gate at a time, and the worker must not fan out multiple remote-I/O maintenance jobs at
  once just because those phases are outside SQLite.
- Request-log GC catch-up must finish one bounded slice, persist its progress message, and requeue a
  fresh `queued` row when more backlog remains instead of keeping one long-lived `running` row while
  waiting for the next catch-up opportunity.
- Service startup must abandon any leftover `queued` or `running` maintenance rows from the previous
  process lifetime rather than implicitly resuming them after restart.
- SQLite file size must converge after retention cleanup. The service must expose DB size/freelist
  telemetry, automatically trigger compaction when reclaimable space crosses the configured
  threshold, and provide a manual compaction trigger. Health checks must remain available while DB
  maintenance is active.
- A one-shot request-log GC CLI must reuse the same bounded cleanup path so production database
  samples can be validated deterministically without waiting for the daily scheduler.
- A one-shot DB compaction CLI must reuse the same threshold logic, support forced execution for a
  maintenance window, and remain available even when the in-process admin trigger is blocked by the
  DB execution gate.
- Request-log GC must avoid high-resource catch-up strategies such as rebuilding the whole
  `request_logs` table or generating a large WAL. Large backlogs are expected to catch up over
  repeated bounded windows.
- Retry logs may include operation, attempt, backoff, and final error context.

## Acceptance

- Under a competing SQLite writer, acquiring a quota subject lock eventually succeeds after the
  writer releases within the existing wait budget.
- Under a competing SQLite writer, scheduled job start retries rather than immediately returning
  `database is locked`.
- Under a competing SQLite writer, forward-proxy startup runtime snapshot persistence retries
  transient lock errors rather than failing the startup path immediately.
- With safely restorable persisted subscription runtime and a slow subscription endpoint, restart
  restores the local runtime and completes without waiting for the slow remote refresh.
- Without persisted subscription runtime, startup remains strict and waits for subscription
  readiness instead of reporting healthy from an empty proxy graph.
- With a large backlog of old request logs, one scheduler pass records bounded progress instead of
  running indefinitely; later catch-up passes eventually remove all rows older than the retention
  threshold.
- Overlapping DB-backed maintenance jobs in one process run through one persisted queue and one
  maintenance worker, so a second job is accepted/coalesced as `queued` instead of competing for the
  SQLite writer slot.
- With two queued remote-I/O maintenance jobs such as `quota_sync`, only one enters the active
  remote phase at a time; the next job remains `queued` until that remote slot clears, while
  non-remote maintenance work may still advance.
- Manual trigger API calls return a representative job id, job rows expose `trigger_source` plus
  `queued_at`, and duplicate active manual triggers coalesce onto the existing queued/running row
  instead of returning `db_job_execution_busy` or duplicate-running conflicts.
- After restart, any leftover `queued` or `running` maintenance rows are marked `abandoned` with a
  completion timestamp before new queue work is accepted.
- With an upstream `/usage` endpoint that hangs past the quota-sync timeout budget, manual and
  scheduler-triggered quota sync runs finish as `error`, leave no long-lived `running` row behind,
  and do not write `api_key_quota_sync_samples` or `api_keys.quota_*`.
- With a stale `quota_sync` or `quota_sync/hot` `running` row older than the configured timeout
  window, the next same-key claim abandons the stale row and starts a fresh run.
- After request-log retention cleanup creates enough freelist pages, DB compaction runs under the
  maintenance gate and reduces the main SQLite file size or reports why compaction was skipped.
- `db_compaction_once --json` reports threshold-based skip vs execution, and `--force` bypasses the
  threshold for a controlled maintenance window.
- `request_logs_gc_once --run-until-complete --json` removes old request logs and catalog rollups
  from a production-derived validation sample and reports `completed=true` when no old rows remain,
  while keeping WAL growth and CPU time bounded.
- Existing billing tests continue to prove locked billing subject stability, pending billing
  replay, and account/token quota attribution.
- Existing MCP/API routing behavior remains unchanged, including research result GET key pinning.
