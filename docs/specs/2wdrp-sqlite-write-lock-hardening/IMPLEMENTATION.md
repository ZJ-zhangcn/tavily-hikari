# Implementation

## Current Coverage

- Added a shared transient SQLite write retry helper for bounded backoff.
- `quota_subject_locks` acquire/refresh/release now retry transient SQLite busy/locked errors within
  the existing lock timeout or lease budget.
- Scheduled job start/finish writes now retry transient SQLite busy/locked errors before surfacing
  failure to background schedulers.
- OAuth account upsert/profile refresh wrapper calls now retry transient SQLite busy/locked errors
  before returning failures to LinuxDo login or daily sync flows.
- Forward-proxy startup now refreshes subscription-backed endpoints concurrently, syncs xray state
  from the restored snapshot, and retries runtime snapshot persistence when SQLite briefly denies
  the write slot.
- Forward-proxy startup now restores persisted subscription endpoints from `forward_proxy_runtime`
  before attempting remote subscription refresh when the current settings contain one unambiguous
  subscription source. If restored endpoints exist, startup skips the blocking remote refresh and
  proceeds to xray sync/runtime persistence; the existing maintenance scheduler performs
  subscription calibration after the service is running.
- LinuxDo system tag binding backfill now uses a single indexed startup precheck and only repairs
  mismatched rows before readiness. A background scheduler periodically refreshes the bindings and
  quota snapshots after the service is already listening.
- Request-log retention GC now runs in bounded batches for both `request_logs` and
  `request_log_catalog_rollups`, yields briefly between batches, and reports whether more catch-up
  work remains.
- Request-log GC unlinks old child-table references before deleting old `request_logs`, ensures
  supporting reference indexes, uses a lightweight CLI open path that skips full startup
  migrations, and disables SQLite secure-delete for the delete connection so retention cleanup does
  not spend extra CPU overwriting expired payload pages.
- Request-log GC temporarily removes and restores the catalog-rollup delete trigger inside each
  batch transaction. The old rollup buckets are deleted separately in bounded batches, avoiding a
  per-row trigger update for expired request payloads while keeping normal request log writes and
  updates covered by the trigger set.
- The daily `request_logs_gc` scheduler now runs one bounded cleanup pass per
  `scheduled_jobs` row. If backlog remains, the scheduler sleeps for the catch-up interval and
  claims a fresh job for the next pass instead of keeping one long-running `running` row open.
- Scheduled jobs now distinguish `trigger_source` from `job_type`, use an atomic claim path to avoid
  duplicate active work, and expose manual trigger entrypoints for maintenance/admin jobs.
- `quota_sync` now uses a hard `/usage` timeout, a bounded job runtime budget, and claim-time stale
  running row reclamation for `quota_sync` / `quota_sync/hot`, so hung syncs self-heal instead of
  blocking future runs until a restart.
- Request-log GC catch-up now uses smaller scheduler windows with a faster recheck cadence so a
  large body-cleanup backlog can make daily progress without one pass holding the SQLite writer
  slot for long.
- DB maintenance now records size/freelist telemetry and can compact the SQLite file through a
  dedicated job, with automatic threshold-based triggering and manual admin triggering.
- Added `db_compaction_once` as an offline operational binary. It reuses the same threshold gate as
  the scheduler, supports `--force`, and avoids depending on the in-process admin trigger when the
  DB execution gate is busy.
- DB-backed scheduled and manual jobs now pass through a process-wide execution gate before their
  SQLite write windows. The gate covers retention GC, compaction, quota sync, rollups, session GC,
  backoff GC, auth-token log GC, and LinuxDo sync/refresh jobs while preserving the existing
  scheduled-job claim/finish semantics.
- Request-log GC catch-up releases the DB job execution gate between cleanup windows so the
  scheduler delay does not block other DB-backed jobs.
- `scheduled_jobs` now persists queue admission explicitly: `queued_at` is stored for every
  maintenance row, `started_at` is nullable until the worker actually starts execution, and job list
  APIs order by `COALESCE(started_at, queued_at)` so queued work remains visible.
- Added queue-side primitives on top of `scheduled_jobs`: enqueue/coalesce, dequeue, mark-running,
  lookup-by-id, and abandon-all-active semantics.
- Scheduler loops now enqueue DB-backed maintenance work instead of trying to claim-and-run inline.
  One in-process maintenance worker consumes queued jobs, preserves manual-first priority, and
  reuses the existing per-job execution logic.
- Remote-I/O maintenance families (`quota_sync*`, LinuxDo user sync, GEO refresh) now share one
  worker-scoped remote slot. That keeps the queue from fan-out marking a burst of `/usage` or GEO
  jobs as `running` all at once, while still allowing DB-only jobs such as `request_logs_gc` to
  advance during a pending remote phase.
- Coalesced active jobs now promote `trigger_source` even while the representative row is already
  `running`, so a later manual trigger is visible in both the returned trigger response and the
  persisted job row instead of being silently hidden behind the original scheduler source.
- Same-priority duplicate manual triggers now take a read-only coalesce fast path before attempting
  a write transaction. That keeps `POST /api/jobs/trigger` from returning transient SQLite
  `database is locked` errors when a bounded GC slice is already running and the request only needs
  to attach to the existing representative row.
- Request-log GC now requeues itself through the persisted queue when a bounded pass reports
  `completed=false`, so backlog catch-up no longer depends on one scheduler loop keeping a running
  row alive.
- Manual `POST /api/jobs/trigger` now accepts/coalesces queue work and returns the representative
  `job_id` instead of exposing `db_job_execution_busy`. The response also exposes representative
  queue hints (`status`, `coalesced`, `promoted`) so the admin UI can distinguish “newly queued”
  from “already running/queued”. Manual key quota sync still waits for a result, but it now does so
  by enqueueing `quota_sync` and polling the representative job row to a terminal state.
- `forward_proxy_geo_refresh` now follows the same split-phase model as quota sync and LinuxDo
  sync: remote trace/GEO discovery happens outside the DB execution gate, candidate persistence and
  `scheduled_jobs` completion happen inside a short DB window, and the worker may continue with
  other queued non-remote jobs while the single remote-I/O slot is in flight.
- Online billing-subject serialization no longer uses `quota_subject_locks` as the request-path
  mutex. The hot path now uses an in-process subject guard, keeping fail-closed billing semantics
  while removing acquire/refresh/release writes for every billable request.
- Added `billing_ledger` as the synchronous billing truth source. Pending/charged state,
  `billing_subject`, `business_credits`, request linkage, and settlement metadata are backfilled
  from `auth_token_logs` at startup and then maintained in `billing_ledger` on every new pending
  billing record and settlement.
- Pending-billing readers and rollups that previously scanned `auth_token_logs.billing_state` now
  read from `billing_ledger`, while `auth_token_logs.billing_state` is still mirrored for backward
  compatibility with existing admin/history surfaces.
- HA baseline capture now includes `billing_ledger`, so recovery/export paths preserve the new
  billing truth table.
- Added an in-process HA state coalescer. `persist_ha_node_state` and
  `persist_ha_sync_watermark` now merge writes inside a `1s / 100 keys` window, and owner-facing
  reads that require immediate consistency explicitly flush before returning.
- Added a request-stats coalescer for request-derived rollups. Hot-path `request_logs` inserts now
  synchronously write only the `request_logs` row itself, then enqueue:
  - dashboard request rollup deltas,
  - API-key usage bucket deltas,
  - request-log catalog rollup deltas,
  - auth-token `total_requests/last_used_at` deltas,
  - account request-rate (`account_usage_rollup_buckets` five-minute) deltas.
- Request-derived rollups now flush in one background batcher (`1s / 100 pending keys`) instead of
  issuing synchronous rollup writes per request. Owner-facing summary, key-metrics, and request-log
  catalog reads flush that coalescer before reading.
- Request observability tables now attach through a per-core sibling sidecar SQLite file
  (`<core-stem>-observability.db`) in the new layout. `request_logs`, `api_key_usage_buckets`,
  `dashboard_request_rollup_buckets`, and `request_log_catalog_rollups` are created in that
  sidecar for the steady-state layout. Smaller legacy single-DB SQLite files still migrate
  `request_logs` into the sidecar during startup, but large legacy DBs now stay on a temporary
  single-DB compatibility path when the inline copy would exceed the startup budget. In that mode,
  `observability` is attached back to the core file for startup and offline `request_logs_gc_once`,
  and no sibling sidecar file is created until a later explicit migration path is available. That
  compatibility path must still keep the normal SQLite pool capacity; collapsing the pool to one
  connection makes `/api/summary` flushes and early scheduler enqueue paths fight for the same slot
  and can leave owner-facing reads returning transient 500s after `/health` is already green.
- Server/admin test helpers now mirror that sidecar layout instead of opening only the core DB
  file. SQLite schema assertions for `request_logs` and the other observability tables now probe
  the attached schema explicitly, which keeps migration and admin-route coverage aligned with the
  production attached-database layout even when both `main` and `observability` temporarily expose
  similarly named tables during legacy migration/repair paths.
- Auth-token list/admin-token/user-token reads and admin rate-5m usage series now also flush the
  request-stats coalescer before reading, so owner-facing token activity and request-rate charts
  stay current without putting those derived writes back on the request hot path.
- `request_log_catalog_rollups` no longer relies on per-request SQLite triggers for normal hot-path
  inserts. Owner-facing catalog reads keep a narrow rebuild-on-read fallback for legacy/manual SQL
  mutations so admin surfaces can self-heal if rollups were emptied or bypassed.
- `/api/logs` page reads now also ensure request-log catalog rollups are available before reading
  totals/facets, so an empty or bypassed rollup table does not make the admin logs surface show an
  empty total while visible `request_logs` rows still exist in the observability sidecar.
- The request-log GC path no longer drops/recreates the catalog delete trigger per batch, because
  the catalog rollup table is now maintained by the request-stats coalescer plus explicit rebuilds.
- SQLite attached-database trigger limits mean observability sidecar tables no longer participate
  in HA outbox trigger replication. Those tables are now treated as rebuildable/eventually
  consistent owner-facing views; the HA baseline remains focused on core truth tables such as
  `billing_ledger`, bindings, quota state, and control-plane facts.
- Auth-token log page/detail queries that join `billing_ledger` now qualify `auth_token_logs.*`
  columns explicitly and avoid unnecessary billing joins in count/facet queries. That removes the
  `ambiguous column name` regressions that appeared once synchronous billing truth moved out of
  `auth_token_logs` and the admin token-log surfaces began reading mixed ledger/history data.
- Service startup now abandons leftover `queued` and `running` maintenance rows from the previous
  process lifetime before starting the new worker.
- Added `request_logs_gc_once` as a one-shot operational binary. It supports JSON output and
  `--run-until-complete` for deterministic low-resource validation against production-derived
  database samples.
- Added `request_logs_gc_stats` as a read-only operational binary for daily growth vs
  `cleaned_bodies` analysis directly from SQLite.
- Added local contention tests for quota subject lock acquisition and scheduled job start.
- Added queue lifecycle tests for coalesced enqueue promotion, delayed `started_at` materialization,
  and abandon-all-active restart cleanup semantics.
- Added coverage for manual trigger coalescing on an already running representative row, including
  the HTTP response hints returned by `/api/jobs/trigger`.
- Added regression coverage for duplicate manual trigger coalescing while another connection holds
  the SQLite writer slot, both at the store layer and through the owner-facing HTTP trigger route.
- Added worker orchestration coverage that proves only one remote-I/O maintenance job enters
  `running` at a time and that `request_logs_gc` can still complete while a quota-sync remote phase
  is waiting on `/usage`.
- Added local contention coverage for forward-proxy startup subscription refresh and runtime
  snapshot persistence.
- Added request-log GC coverage for old-row deletion, recent-row preservation, partial catch-up,
  catalog rollup cleanup, and transient SQLite write-lock retry.
- Added request-stats coverage proving summary/key-metric reads flush pending coalesced deltas
  before returning.
- Added request-stats coverage proving auth-token activity reads and admin rate-5m usage-series
  reads flush pending coalesced deltas before returning.
- Added request-log catalog coverage proving catalog reads still self-heal after direct SQL
  `request_logs` mutations and rollup rebuild scenarios.
- Added server-level regression coverage proving the admin logs page still returns rows/totals from
  the sidecar-backed `request_logs` layout and that token-log detail/page reads remain stable after
  the `billing_ledger` join split.
- Added process-level DB job execution gate coverage that proves overlapping jobs serialize before
  entering their write windows.
- Added startup-order coverage for restored subscription runtime with a slow subscription endpoint,
  plus the strict no-runtime fallback where startup still waits for subscription readiness.

## Operations Notes

- Production baseline was read-only: container healthy, version `0.46.2`, database `8.3G`, WAL
  `235M`, and the most recent one-hour lock sample only showed LinuxDo OAuth upsert contention.
- Later production inspection found a `20G` database where startup spent roughly `78s` inside
  SQLite initialization; the repeated LinuxDo tag binding refresh over all OAuth accounts was a
  primary avoidable startup cost, so periodic refresh now runs outside the readiness path.
- A later request-log body-retention backlog produced a much larger main DB file even after row
  retention was no longer the primary issue. Deleting or nulling payloads alone leaves free pages in
  SQLite, so file-size convergence is handled as a separate compaction job after retention work.
- If production inspection shows long-lived `scheduled_jobs.running` rows from an older process,
  restart the service under the current stale-job cleanup path before relying on manual retriggers.
  The in-process execution gate prevents new same-process overlap; it does not rewrite stale rows
  while the old process is still considered active.
- The SQLite pool now defaults to `max_connections=3` instead of `5`, preserving WAL mode while
  reducing writer contention on the single-file production database.
- The recommended release path for this class of issue is: deploy code, perform one controlled
  restart, verify `/health`, inspect `scheduled_jobs` / `database is locked` logs, continue
  `request_logs_gc_once` if backlog remains, and only invoke `db_compaction_once` when reclaimable
  space crosses the threshold or operators explicitly force a maintenance window.
